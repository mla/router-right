  - IMPORTANT! Note potential non-backwards compatible change:

  - The match() method now returns a blessed match instance.

    Under the hood, it is still a hash reference and still only contains
    the payload contents, so as long as your code does not test whether
    the payload is blessed, it should continue to work as before.

    To revert to the old behavior, create a Router::Right subclass and
    override the _match_class() method to return the undefined value.

  - Tie::IxHash used in url() method to maintain ordering of parameters
    as passed in.
