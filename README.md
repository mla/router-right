# SYNOPSIS

    use Router::Right;

    my $r = Router::Right->new;

    $r->add(home => '/', 'Home#show');
    $r->add(blog => '/blog/{year}/{month}', 'Blog#monthly');

    my $match = $r->match('/blog/1916/08'); 

    # Returns {
    #   controller => 'Blog',
    #   action => 'monthly',
    #   year => '1916',
    #   month => '08',
    # }

# DESCRIPTION

Router::Right is a Perl5-based, framework-agnostic routing engine used to
map web application request URLs to application handlers.

# METHODS

- new()

    Returns a new Router::Right instance

- add($name => $route\_path, \\%payload \[, %options\])

    Define a route. $name is used to reference the route elsewhere. On a successful match, the payload hash reference is returned; by convention, a payload includes "controller" and "action" values. For example:

        $r->add(entries => '/entries', { controller => 'Entries', action => 'show' })

    See the ROUTE DEFINITION section for details on how $route\_path values are specified.

    Also, if the payload consists solely of controller and action values, it can be specified as a string in the format "controller#action". For example:

        $r->add(entries => '/entries', 'Entries#show')

    is exactly equivalent to specifying a payload of: { controller => 'Entries', action => 'show' }.

    By default, routes match any HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST). To restrict them, supply a "methods" option. e.g.,

        $r->add(entries => '/entries', 'Entries#show', methods => 'GET')

    That would only match GET requests. The value may be either a string or an array reference of
    strings. e.g.,

        $r->add(entries => '/entries', 'Entries#show', methods => [qw/ GET POST /])

    Method strings are case-insensitive. As a convenience, the allowed methods can also be specified
    as part of the route path itself. e.g.,

        $r->add(entries => 'GET|POST /entries', 'Entries#show')

- match($url \[, $method\])

    Attempts to find a route that matches the supplied $url. Routes are matched in the order defined.

    If a match is found, its associated payload is returned. If not, undef is returned and the error() method will indicate why the match failed.

    $method, if supplied, is the HTTP method of the request (e.g., GET, POST, etc.). Specifying $method may prevent a route from otherwise matching if the route was defined with a restricted set of allowed methods (see ROUTE DEFINITION). By default, all request methods are allowed.

    The payload is returned as a blessed hash reference (by default, a
    Router::Right::Match instance). The match class can be changed/customized
    by creating a Router::Right subclass and overridding the \_match\_class()
    method.

- error()

    Returns the error code of the last failed match.

        404 = no match found
        405 = method not allowed

    A 405 result indicates a match was found, but the request method was not allowed. allowed\_methods() can be called to obtain a list of the methods that are permitted for the route.

    The above error codes are also available as symbolic constants through the NOT\_FOUND and
    METHOD\_NOT\_ALLOWED functions.

- allowed\_methods(\[ $name \])

    Returns the list of allowed methods for a given route name or path. In list context, returns a list. In scalar context, returns an array reference. An empty list/array indicates that all methods are
    permitted.

    If route $name is supplied, returns its permitted methods. Returns undef in scalar context if the route is unknown. If $name contains a forward slash, it's intepreted as a route path, instead.

    With no argument, returns the methods permitted by the last match() attempt. Returns undef in scalar context if there was no prior match.

        $r->add(entries => 'PUT|GET /entries', { controller => 'Entries' });
        print join(', ', $r->allowed_methods('entries')), "\n"; # prints GET, PUT

- url($name \[, %params\])

    Constructs a URL from the $name route. Placeholder values are supplied as %params. Unknown placeholder values are appended as query string parameters.

    Example:

        $r->add(entry => '/entries/{year}', { controller => 'Entry' });
        $r->url('entry', year => '1916', q => 'abc'); # produces /entries/1916?q=abc 

    The return value is a [URI](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI) instance.

- as\_string()

    Returns a report of the defined routes, in order of definition.

- with($name => $route\_path \[, %options\]

    Helper method to share information across multiple routes. For example:

        $r->with(admin => '/admin',        'Admin')
          ->add(users  => '/users',        '#users')
          ->add(trx    => '/transactions', '#transactions')
        ;

        print $r->as_string;

        # prints:
        #   admin_users * /admin/users        { action => "users", controller => "Admin" }
        #   admin_trx   * /admin/transactions { action => "transactions", controller => "Admin" }

    The payload contents are merged. The route names are joined by an underscore. The paths are concatenated. Either or both of $name and $route\_path may be undefined.

    If a nested route specifies a controller beginning with '::', it is concatenated with
    the outer controller name. For example:

        $r->with(admin => '/admin', 'Admin')
          ->add(users  => '/users', '::User#show')
        ;

        print $r->as_string;

        # prints:
        #   admin_users * /admin/users { action => "show", controller => "Admin::User" }

    A callback is accepted, which allows chaining with() calls:

        $r->with(admin => '/admin',  { controller => 'Admin' }, call => sub {
          $_->add(users => '/users', { action => 'users' });
          $_->add(log   => '/log',   { action => 'log' });
        })->with(dashboard => '/dashboard', { controller => 'Admin::Dashboard' }, call => sub {
          $_->add(view => '/{action}');
        });

        print $r->as_string;

        # prints:
        #   admin_users          * /admin/users
        #   admin_log            * /admin/log
        #   admin_dashboard_view * /admin/dashboard/{action}

    Within the callback function, $\_ is set to the router instance. It is also supplied as a parameter.

- resource($name, \\%payload \[, %options\])

    Adds routes to create, read, update, and delete a given resource. For example:

        my $r = Router::Right->new->resource('message', { controller => 'Message' });
        print $r->as_string, "\n";

        # prints:
        #                 messages GET    /messages{.format}           { action => "index", controller => "Message" }
        #                          POST   /messages{.format}           { action => "create", controller => "Message" }
        #       formatted_messages GET    /messages.{format}           { action => "index", controller => "Message" }
        #              new_message GET    /messages/new{.format}       { action => "new", controller => "Message" }
        #    formatted_new_message GET    /messages/new.{format}       { action => "new", controller => "Message" }
        #                  message GET    /messages/{id}{.format}      { action => "show", controller => "Message" }
        #                          PUT    /messages/{id}{.format}      { action => "update", controller => "Message" }
        #                          DELETE /messages/{id}{.format}      { action => "delete", controller => "Message" }
        #        formatted_message GET    /messages/{id}.{format}      { action => "show", controller => "Message" }
        #             edit_message GET    /messages/{id}{.format}/edit { action => "edit", controller => "Message" }
        #   formatted_edit_message GET    /messages/{id}.{format}/edit { action => "edit", controller => "Message" }

# ROUTE DEFINITION

A route path is a normal URL path with the addition of placeholder variables. For example:

    $r->add(entries => '/entries/{year}/{month}');

defines a route path containing two placeholders, "year" and "month'. By default, a placeholder matches any string up to the next forward slash.

Placeholder names must not begin with a number, nor contain hyphens or forward slashes.

The default match rule may be overridden. For example:

    $r->add(entries => '/entries/{year:\d+}/{month:\d+}');

is the same as above, except it will only match if both the year and month contain only digits.

The special {.format} placeholder can be used to allow an optional file extension to be appended. For example:

    $r->add(download => '/dl/{file}{.format}', { controller => 'Download' });
    $r->match('/dl/foo.gz'); # returns { controller => 'Download', file => 'foo', format => 'gz' }
    $r->match('/dl/foo');    # returns { controller => 'Download', file => 'foo' }

    # And to build a URL from it:
    $r->url('download', file => 'foo', format => 'bz2'); # /dl/foo.bz2
